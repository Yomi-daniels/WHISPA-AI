🔐 AI-Based Voice Recognition Security System
📘 Overview
This project implements an AI-powered voice recognition system designed for secure, hands-free authentication. It uses vocal biometrics to verify users and grant access to protected areas or applications. The system integrates AI algorithms, audio preprocessing, and database-backed user authentication for high accuracy and operational efficiency.

🚀 Features
🎙️ Voice-Based Authentication

🛡️ Spoofing Detection with AI

🔁 Real-Time Audio Processing

📊 Logging & Monitoring System

🔒 Secure Voiceprint Storage

📈 Performance Metrics Dashboard

🧩 Modular Architecture for Easy Integration

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
Python / TensorFlow / Keras – AI model training and inference

JavaScript / HTML / CSS – User interface and frontend interactions

MySQL / PostgreSQL – Relational database for storing users, voiceprints, and logs

Flask / Node.js – API server for processing requests and handling authentication logic

WebRTC / MediaRecorder API – Audio capture in browser

🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-auth-system.git
cd voice-auth-system
2. Set Up the Backend (Python/Flask)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
3. Set Up the Frontend
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
open index.html  # Or use a local server like Live Server in VS Code
4. Database Configuration
Create a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.

Import the provided schema in database/schema.sql.

Update config.py or .env with your DB credentials.

🎯 Usage Guide
Register a New User

Navigate to /register page.

Fill in user details and record a voice sample.

Login Using Voice

Click on the microphone icon.

Speak the assigned phrase or command.

The system compares your voice against the stored voiceprint.

Admin Monitoring

View system logs and user authentication attempts.

Monitor failed attempts and voice mismatch alerts.

📊 Performance Metrics (KPIs)
Authentication Accuracy: Measures false accept/reject rates.

Authentication Speed: Time taken from voice input to response.

Adoption Rate: Number of users using voice auth.

System Logs: Tracks all activity for auditing.

📌 Security Considerations
All voice data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

User information is secured with hashed identifiers.

System enforces access control and role-based permissions.
